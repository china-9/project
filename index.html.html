        <h2>INTERNET BUSINESS RESEARCH</h2>
    </body>
    <body>
        <p>Various kinds of surveys that can be conducted online are typically referred to as “internet research” or “web surveys.” Internet research refers to the distribution of questionnaires and collection of responses via email or dedicated systems.
            Internet research refers to the process of gathering, analyzing, and interpreting information available on the internet to obtain insights, answer questions, solve problems, or make informed decisions. It involves utilizing various online resources such as search engines, databases, websites, social media platforms, and online forums to collect data and information relevant to a specific topic, industry, market, or research objective.</p>

        <h2>LESSON 1:INTERNET BROWSERS </h2> 
    </body>
    <body>
         <h4><b>Identifying Browsers</b></h4>
         <p>An internet browser, also known as a web browser or simply a browser, is a software program that lets you view web pages on your computer.
            The main purpose of an internet browser is to translate the code that computers use to create websites into the text, graphics, and other features of the web pages that we're used to seeing today.
            Web browsers were first introduced in 1990, but they've evolved significantly since then.</p>
        <h4><b>The First Web Browser</b></h4>
        <p>The first web browser was called World Wide Web; later, it changed its name to Nexus. Created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, it gave people a basic way to view web pages. However, it was a long way from the immersive online experience we have today.
            Without graphical browsers, the internet as we know it today would not be possible. In the 90s, the internet was text-based, bland, and couldn't be used without some fairly significant technical knowledge. This limited the number of people who had the interest and the ability to use the internet.
            In the early 90s, the audience was so small and so niche that most companies didn't have an online presence. Shopping giants like eBay and Amazon would never have had a chance of drawing a decent crowd.
            That started to change with the introduction of Mosaic in 1992.
            The Mosaic browser helped make the internet ubiquitous. The graphical interface made navigating the web easy to understand and the ability to display graphics on websites made web pages more interesting. Best of all, people no longer needed to be programmers to enjoy themselves online.
            With more people spending more time on the internet, companies were quick to follow. E-commerce, online sweepstakes, social media, and many other things we take for granted today followed closely on the heels of the first graphical browsers.</p>
        <h4>Modern Internet Browsers</h4>
        <p>Internet browsers have developed into powerful tools that let you safely and quickly access your favorite websites.
            Modern internet browsers have many helpful features. Tabbed browsing, for example, lets you open up many web pages in individual tabs, instead of needing a resource-intensive separate window for each page. This is very helpful if you want to enter sweepstakes faster. Modern browsers offer security features, embedded video, nigh-instant loading times, and many other things that make the net such a fun place to spend time
            Which Internet Browsers Are Available Today?
            Most browsers are available for free download. The six most popular internet browsers today include:
            <li>
            Mozilla Firefox</li>
            <li>
            Google Chrome</li>
            <li>Microsoft Edge (formerly Internet Explorer)</li>
            <li>Apple Safari</li>
            <li> Opera </li>  
           <li> Brave  </li> </p>
        <h5>How Internet Browsers Work:</h5>     
        <p>Here's a very quick overview of how browsers work:
            <li><i>
                You type a website's URL into your browser's address bar; <ins>"http://www.dotdash.com"</ins> is an example of a URL.
             <li>  
                The browser locates and requests that page's information from a web server.</li> 
            <li>    
                The browser receives a file written in computer code, like HTML or Javascript, which includes instructions about how to display the information on that page.</li> 
            <li>  
                The browser interprets that file and displays the page for you to read and interact with. And it does all of this in just a few seconds, usually.</i></li></p>
            <p>    The important thing to know is that different browsers have slightly different ways of working so that if you are having trouble getting pages to display or sweepstakes to load on one browser, it makes sense to try another. Install two or three of your favorite browsers and switch between them if you're having trouble seeing a website properly.       
        </p>
        <h4>Basics Browser Tools</h4>
        <p><li>
            <ins>Hyperlinks </ins>- A hyperlink is an element in an HTML document that links to either another portion of the document or to another document altogether. On webpages, hyperlinks are usually colored purple or blue and are sometimes underlined.</li>
           <li>
           <ins> Bonus Tools</ins> – it’s a tools extra tools or extra setting of a browsers
            Example: Browsers VPN, Extension, History Logs and etc.</li>
           <li>
            <ins>World Wide Web </ins>- also known as the web
            Refers to all the public websites or pages that users can access on their local computers and other devices through the internet. These pages and documents are interconnected by means of hyperlinks that users click on for information. This information can be in different formats, including text, images, audio and video.</li></p>
        <h4>How does the World Wide Web work?</h4>    
        <p>Paving the way for an internet revolution that has transformed the world in only three decades, the World Wide Web consists of multiple components that enable users to access various resources, documents and web pages on the internet. Thus, the WWW is like a vast electronic book whose pages are stored or hosted on different servers worldwide.
            These pages are the primary component or building blocks of the WWW and are linked through hyperlinks, which provide access from one specific spot in a hypertext or hypermedia document to another spot within that document or a different one. Hyperlinks are another defining concept of the WWW and provide its identity as a collection of interconnected documents.</p>
        <p><b>Hypertext</b> is a method for instant information cross-referencing that supports communications on the web. Hypertext makes it easy to link content on one web page to content on another web page or site. Hypertext and HTTP enable people to access the millions of websites active on the WWW. </p>
        
        <h2> LESSON 2:INTRODUCTION TO ETHICAL BUSINESS RESEARCH</h2>
        <p><b>Objective:</b> The primary objective of ethical business research is to conduct investigations and inquiries with integrity, transparency, and a commitment to ethical principles.

            </P>
        
            <h2> LESSON 3: DATA AND CUSTOMER RIGHTS</h2>
        <p>Data refers to raw facts, figures, or information typically stored and processed by computer systems. It can encompass a wide range of types, including text, numbers, images, audio, video, and more. In the context of modern technology and digital systems, data is often collected, processed, and analyzed to derive insights, make decisions, or perform various tasks.</p>
        <p>Customer rights, on the other hand, refer to the entitlements and protections afforded to individuals or entities who engage in transactions or relationships with businesses or organizations. These rights are established to ensure fair treatment, privacy, and security for customers in various interactions, particularly in the context of commerce and services.</p>
        
        <p><b>Customer rights may include:</b></p>
        <p><i>Privacy</i></p>
        <p><i>Security</i></p>
        <p><i>Transparency</i></p>
        <p><i>Access and Control</i></p>
        <p><i>Fair Treatment</i></p>
        <p><i>Redress</i></p>
        <p>Data and customer rights are fundamental concepts in the digital age, especially with the increasing use of technology and the collection of personal information.</p>
        <p><i>Here's a breakdown of each:</i></p>

        <p><b>1. Data Rights:</b></p>
        <li>Ownership</li>
        <li> Privacy</li>
        <li>Access</li>
        <li>Correction</li>
        <li>Deletion</li>
        <li>Portability</li>
        <li>Consent</li>
        <li>Security</li>

        <p><b>2. Customer Rights:</b></p>
        <li>a. Consumer Protection</li>
        <li>b. Product Safety</li>
        <li>c. Fair Pricing</li>
        <li>d. Consumer Education</li>
        <li>e. Redress</li>
        <li>f. Non-Discrimination</li>
        <li>g. Right to Information</li>
        <li>h. Complaint Resolution</li>
        <p><small>Note: Both data rights and customer rights are essential for protecting individuals' privacy, ensuring fair treatment, and fostering trust between businesses and consumers in the digital marketplace. Governments and regulatory bodies often establish laws and regulations to safeguard these rights and hold organizations accountable for any violations.</small></p>
        <p><b>PERSONAL DATA</b></p>
        <p>Personal data refers to any information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual.

        <p><mark>EUROPEAN UNION</mark></p>
        <p>The history of the European Union (EU) has been marked by periods of rapid change followed by periods of uncertainty:
            European integration has been an unpredictable process.</p>
        <p><mark>Origins</mark></p>   
         <p>The European project was an attempt to overcome the nationalist conflicts of the first half of the twentieth century, especially the rivalry between Germany and France that had contributed to both world wars. After
            1945, there was a strong will to ensure that war between Germany and France could never again occur. This led to a series of schemes that culminated in the establishment of the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1957, which eventually became the EU. Led in the early 1950s by Frenchmen Robert Schuman and Jean Monnet, the initial plan was for a European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) that would make France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg co-operate by forcing them to share their coal and steel resources in the post-war rebuilding of western Europe. This created the organizational model of a Commission, Council and Parliament that was adopted by the EEC.</p>
         <p><mark>Founding the EU</mark></p> 
         <p>The EEC was established under the Treaty of Rome in 1957. Primarily, the EEC aimed to extend the principle behind the ECSC to other areas of trade by creating a customs union. However, it also had more political ambitions for European integration – described at the start of the treaty as creating ‘an ever-closer union between the peoples of Europe.
            Yet this mixture of economic and political union was not the only option open to European countries in the 1950s. Britain, Switzerland, Austria and the Scandinavian countries were at this time engaged in the European Free Trade Area (EFTA): a looser organization based on a zone of free trade without an external tariff barrier.
            The early years of the EEC were principally focused upon developing the customs union. During this period, a huge economic boom, led by a dynamic West Germany, created much greater prosperity in western Europe and drove forward the liberalization of the EEC economy. In 1963, Britain made its first attempt to join but was rebuffed by the French President Charles De Gaulle. De Gaulle dominated the European Community in the 1960s, fueling conflict between those who wanted to push forward a political union and those, like himself, who wanted to maintain their national identities.
            By the 1970s, when Britain, Ireland and Denmark finally joined the EEC, the project had slowed down considerably. Although the 1970s saw the first proposals for monetary union, the EEC of nine states found it more difficult to reach agreement than the original six had.</p>  
        <p><mark>Faster Integration</mark></p>    
        <p>It was not until the mid-1980s - when Spain, Greece and Portugal joined that the pace of European integration really picked up again with the agreement of the Single European Act (1986). This laid down a timetable for the completion of the single market while looking towards creating monetary union and driving forward the agenda for political union.
            The 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Germany in 1990 provided a huge boost to this process. In 1992, the Maastricht Treaty transformed the European Community – turning it into the EU, giving it new roles in the areas of foreign and domestic policy, and setting a timetable for the creation of the Euro. Subsequently, the treaties of Amsterdam (1997) and Nice (2001) expanded these powers.
            The EU today A Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, drafted in 2004, was rejected by referendums in France and the Netherlands in 2005. The ‘constitutional project’ was then revived in the form of the Lisbon Treaty, which was signed by the leaders of EU nations in 2007. The treaty was hugely controversial because it was very similar to the failed constitution. The treaty was rejected by Ireland in a referendum in 2008, however Ireland eventually ratified the treaty following a second referendum in October 2009. The Lisbon Treaty finally came into force in December 2009.</p>
        <p><mark>FUTURE OF CUSTOMER DATA RIGHTS</mark></p>  
        <p>Consumer rights can be defined as the right to safety, the right to be informed, the right to choose, and the right to be heard. These rights were meant to ensure consumers' fair treatment and that they had the information they needed to make informed decisions about the products and services they bought.</p>
        <p><em>What are the basic rights of customers?</em></p> 
        <p>The eight consumer rights are: Right to basic needs, right to safety, Right to information, Right to choose, Right to representation, Right to redress, Right to consumer education, and Right to healthy environment.</p>
        <p><em>What is RA 7394 in the Philippines?</em></p>
        <p>This act shall be known as the <strong>"Consumer Act of the Philippines". - ARTICLE 2. Declaration of Basic Policy.</strong> It is the policy of the State to protect the interest of the consumer, promote his general welfare and to establish standards of conduct for business and industry.
            The future of customer data rights is likely to evolve in response to several key trends and developments:</p>
            <li><i>Stricter Regulations</i></li>
            <li><i>Empowerment and Control</i></li>   
            <li><i>Data Transparency and Accountability</i></li> 
            <li><i>Emergence of Data Privacy Technologies</i></li> 
            <li><i>Focus on Ethical Data Use</i></li> 
            <li><i>International Collaboration</i></li> 
            <p><small><i>Overall, the future of customer data rights will be characterized by a heightened focus on privacy, transparency, empowerment, and accountability, driven by advancements in technology, changing consumer expectations, and evolving regulatory landscapes. Businesses that prioritize and respect customer data rights will not only comply with legal requirements but also build trust and loyalty with their customers in an increasingly data-driven world.</i></small></p>
